			Note that the functionality that deals with closing the splashscreen
			and popping up the notification dialog, when the application is ready 
			to use, are provided in this application in <code>js/index.js</code>

			The entry point to call native functionality (splashscreen and
			dialogs in this sample) is <code>cordova.js</code>, which is added 
			to the project during build time.
